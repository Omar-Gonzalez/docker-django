# Docker-Django Container

## Project goal

I wanted a bootstrap project for my contractor & personal work with the Django-Framework

## Static Files

For static files I'm using Whitenoise alongside Guinicorn, saves you lots of headaches, plus to my understanding performance is pretty good.

## Usage

* Just set up your .env file following env-example
* docker-compose up
* Check docker-compose and env variables everything is pretty much self-explanatory
* You can enter postgres at localhost:whatever port you set
